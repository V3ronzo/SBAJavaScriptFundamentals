WOOOOSAAAHHHHHHHH 

THIS ASSIGNMENT WAS ... HARD. 
it stretched me in a lot of ways but i did learn a lot . It also showed me how much extra studying I need to do so im probably going to quit my second job for a bit. I usually ONLY have time for class and maybe an hour or so grace period to sleep. have to take care of the family and eat /clean... sheesh. 
But i did learn a bit more so that's good. 
im LOCKED IN! ......... still .. this here! OUCH! 
This showed me why some people who make way more money than me in the industry DON'T code or just do front end .
woooosaahhh

i honestly hated this bc i hate not , NOT getting something that seems so close. but a win is a win if i did somethhing right. brainstormed with a group. googled . had 20 tabs open. typed a few pieces in my notes app and  just added them in piece by piece . 
cried a river, exhaled, gave up , came back... logged in to ''YOUTUBE U'' LOL. 

**** I WISSHHHH we had another week of learning this**** i am exhausted. 

I get now the ''why' this could be used in real world . that helps. I wish the assignment creators would "Show" real world examples. It helps to ground the information into practical / tangible instances. Which would help learning better.
